# Landing Page Template

## Project description
The main goal of this project is to practice manipulating the DOM using JavaScript.

Basically, it is a landing page that has a variable number of sections and a navigation bar for scrolling between those sections, the active section is given a bit of a style as well as it's navigation list item.

This can be done in many ways, however, I preferred the object-oriented approach.
The plan at first was to make use of the observer pattern and the abstract factory pattern, but it turns out that the project is way simpler than that, and a basic SectionFactory class in combination with a Section class did just fine.
